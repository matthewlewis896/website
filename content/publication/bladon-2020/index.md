abstract: "Understanding which factors influence the ability of individuals to respond\
  \ to changing temperatures is fundamental to species conservation under climate\
  \ change. We investigated how a community of butterflies responded to fine-scale\
  \ changes in air temperature, and whether species-specific responses were predicted\
  \ by ecological or morphological traits. Using data collected across a UK reserve\
  \ network, we investigated the ability of 29 butterfly species to buffer thoracic\
  \ temperature against changes in air temperature. First, we tested whether differences\
  \ were attributable to taxonomic family, morphology or habitat association. We then\
  \ investigated the relative importance of two buffering mechanisms: behavioural\
  \ thermoregulation versus fine-scale microclimate selection. Finally, we tested\
  \ whether species' responses to changing temperatures predicted their population\
  \ trends from a UK-wide dataset. We found significant interspecific variation in\
  \ buffering ability, which varied between families and increased with wing length.\
  \ We also found interspecific differences in the relative importance of the two\
  \ buffering mechanisms, with species relying on microclimate selection suffering\
  \ larger population declines over the last 40 years than those that could alter\
  \ their temperature behaviourally. Our results highlight the importance of understanding\
  \ how different species respond to fine-scale temperature variation, and the value\
  \ of taking microclimate into account in conservation management to ensure favourable\
  \ conditions are maintained for temperature-sensitive species."
