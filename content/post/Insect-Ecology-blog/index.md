Almost the first thing you see when visiting the Museum of Zoology in Cambridge is a dodo skeleton – one of the most complete skeletons in the country in fact. This relic lives on to tell the dodo’s sad tale from discovery to extinction within a century. Pop culture has since immortalised the dodo as an icon of extinction: a viscerally moving emblem of the wanton destruction of the natural world by humankind. However, since the dodo’s 17th-century extinction, things have not improved. Development, industrialisation, and rampant consumerism have driven species to extinction across the globe, from the striking Tasmanian tiger persecuted and bounty hunted in the 1930s, to the Large Copper butterfly left stranded when fenland was drained to create arable fields in Victorian Britain. Just last year, it was estimated that a quarter of all species on the planet are threatened with extinction [1](https://ipbes.net/sites/default/files/inline/files/ipbes_global_assessment_report_summary_for_policymakers.pdf), driven by habitat loss, exploitation, climate change, pollution – in short, driven by humanity.

For all of our great advances, our towers piercing the clouds, our healthcare, our triple plastic-wrapped ready meals, we have lost our focus. The word ‘focus’ derives from the Latin for ‘hearth’, and, for much of human history, fire has been at the core of our lives. Is there a more compelling picture of connection to nature than early humans gathered around a fire to keep the wild at bay? In contrast, what wilderness remains must now be sought out, protected and improved. In lockdown, more people have turned to the natural world as they step away from work and look for comfort, or adventure. Freed of a daily commute, have we refocused? Have we rediscovered that tendril of excitement, of fear, of joy that comes at the jump of a frog, the laugh of a hyaena, the flutter of a butterfly’s wings?

In the fullness of time, extinction is inevitable. Everything has its time, and everything must die. The difference is that humans are killing species a thousand times faster than they would otherwise disappear [2](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12380). One of the tragedies of conservation is that many species unknown to science will disappear before they are discovered, but a deeper blot on our record is the disappearance of species we know and had the knowledge and opportunity to save. Have you heard of the Bramble Cay melomys? It was a small mouse endemic to a coral cay on the Great Barrier Reef. Increased frequency of tropical storms drove it to extinction in 2015, the first mammalian victim of human-caused climate change [3](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/13132/97448475). It was a footnote in the news. You might have missed it.

As a conservationist, I ardently believe that we should fight against this tide of extinction and conserve as many species as possible. This requires careful prioritisation of what to conserve, and, with limited funds, conserving areas with multiple benefits for biodiversity, carbon, water, and people must be our aim. On the other hand, that does not diminish the unimpeachable right of a species, any species, to exist simply because it already exists. This conflict of interest between morality and economic practicality has been hotly debated by conservationists for decades [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/443027a) and is a key question when deciding on international commitments, such as the post-2020 agenda. At what stage have we pledged to save enough species? Protecting 30% of land? 50% of land? 100% of species?

For my part, I am currently working on the moral side of the table, focusing on a single threatened species and trying to protect it. In the UK, over three quarters of our butterflies have declined in distribution or abundance since the mid-seventies [5]. The species I work on, the Small Heath (Coenonympha pamphilus) is unfortunately part of this pattern, having declined by 57% in distribution, with monitored populations more than halving since 1976 [5](https://butterfly-conservation.org/sites/default/files/soukb-2015.pdf). Unassumingly orangey-brown, Small Heath are found in grassland habitats across the country, yet often I’m met with blank stares on mentioning them. Those that do know their name are invariably surprised to hear they’re declining, given their wide distribution and high numbers in August. Whenever this happens, I’m reminded of the poor house sparrow, which for decades was considered a waste of monitoring rings as it was so common and so was only found to be in decline when people started to note their absence in gardens. Much like the house sparrow, when you get to know them, Small Heath are wonderfully charismatic, and watching their aerial chases or the flicker of golden orange as they fly can brighten any walk. Thankfully though, the story of monitoring for Small Heath is different to that of the house sparrow and we have good data on their decline, though little information yet as to the reasons why. Still widely distributed and relatively abundant, now is the ideal time to find this information before the species declines further.

As one of the research priorities for Butterfly Conservation, the Small Heath has had a UK Biodiversity Action Plan since 2007 calling for urgent research into the butterfly’s rapid decline, but limited progress toward this goal has been made. For my MPhil research, I’m aiming to fill this gap by assessing the causes of Small Heath declines and how we could better manage reserves for their conservation. Using data from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, I’m able to investigate the roles of climate, land use, nitrogen and other factors in population trends at sites across the country. Combining this with targeted site-level surveys investigating fine-scale habitat preferences, and behavioural studies, I hope to provide reserve managers with advice to help reverse the national decline.
 
So next time you’re walking past a dodo skeleton, or watching a nature documentary about a polar bear, spare a thought too for the less immediately impressive, though no less charming, animals that are declining as well. These species deserve our help just as much as any other. Rediscover that lost focus on the wild. Find a grassy meadow and experience the bewitching lives of the other animals that call this planet home.
